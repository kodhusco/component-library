# Quickstart
The library is a npm package with the following name `design-library`.

Install the dependency using `yarn` or `npm` as follow:

```js
yarn add design-library react styled-components
```

> You can see that we are also installing react and styled-components which are dependencies for our library.

For example if you want to use button component the sample will be as follow:

```
import { Button } from 'design-library';
```

and then add it as follow:
```
// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'design-library';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>Click Me!</ButtonPrimary>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
